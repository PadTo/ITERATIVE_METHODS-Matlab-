# Iterative Methods for Numerical Analysis in MATLAB

## Description:

This repository holds a collection of MATLAB Live Scripts demonstrating a variety of iterative methods for solving linear systems, which are fundamental techniques in numerical analysis. Each script is tailored to explain and implement a specific method, providing a clear understanding of their applications and efficiencies.

## Repository Contents:

- Cramers_Rule.mlx: Implements Cramer's Rule for solving linear systems with a unique solution.
- Gauss_Seidel.mlx: Demonstrates the Gauss-Seidel method, an iterative technique for solving a system of linear equations.
-Gaussian.mlx: Applies the Gaussian elimination method for solving linear equations.
- Jacobian.mlx: Contains the implementation of the Jacobi iterative algorithm, another method for determining the solutions of a diagonally dominant system of linear equations.
- Simple_Iterative_Method.mlx: Showcases a simple iterative approach to approximate solutions of linear systems.
- Successive_Relaxation.mlx: Introduces the method of successive over-relaxation (SOR), an iterative technique for accelerating the convergence of the Gauss-Seidel method.
## Learning Outcomes:

- Exploration of different iterative methods for solving linear equations.
- Insight into the convergence criteria and efficiency of each method.
- Hands-on experience with MATLAB's capabilities for numerical simulation and visualization.
## Usage:

To execute these scripts, open them in MATLAB and run. Each script is self-contained and includes comments explaining the methodology and steps.
The scripts can serve as educational material for those learning about numerical methods in mathematics or engineering courses.
Contributions:

Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially if they include improvements, alternative approaches, or additional iterative methods.
## Academic Notice:
The scripts here were part of an academic module focusing on numerical analysis in MATLAB. The methods implemented are standard algorithms taught in computational mathematics courses.
